// This header file declares a class template called Digraph, which is
// intended to implement a generic directed graph.  The implementation
// uses the adjacency lists technique, so each vertex stores a linked
// list of its outgoing edges.
//
// Along with the Digraph class template is a class DigraphException
// and a couple of utility structs that aren't generally useful outside
// of this header file.
//
// In general, directed graphs are all the same, except in the sense
// that they store different kinds of information about each vertex and
// about each edge; these two types are the type parameters to the
// Digraph class template.
